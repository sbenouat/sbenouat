### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sami, I'm a student at 42 Paris and a freelance working majorly with Python for web scraping and programming bots.

- I use Scrapy, Selenium, Requests and BeautifulSoup as libraries to get the job done. 
- I have already scraped e-commerce, real estate, job boards, betting, social media, etc. 
- I usually put my data in CSV and JSON formats, but I am really versatile and always do what the client wants. 
- I'm easy to understand and work with and I'm sure to deliver the job to your satisfaction. 

Send me an invite/message, I am very much available and happy to talk about how we can work together.
